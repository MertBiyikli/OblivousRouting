CMake Warning (dev) at CMakeLists.txt:10 (find_package):
  Policy CMP0144 is not set: find_package uses upper-case <PACKAGENAME>_ROOT
  variables.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0144" for policy details.  Use the
  cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  CMake variable BOOST_ROOT is set to:

    /usr/local/opt/boost

  For compatibility, find_package is ignoring the variable, but code in a
  .cmake module might still use it.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

CMake Warning (dev) at CMakeLists.txt:10 (find_package):

  set the policy and suppress this warning.

This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
